            <p>I am an innovative and detail oriented professional located in Huntsville, Alabama that is working to transition from management into the world of full stack development. I currently have experience with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>I am currently attending American Military Univeristy pursuing my Bachelor's of Science in Information Technology with a concentration in Multitier Architecture. I am looking to continue to develop my knowledge and skills in development through continued education and am expecting to graduate early 2025.</p>
            <p>Currently, I work for the 3rd party quality company Stratosphere Quality as a Site Operations Manager responsible for 100+ employees. I am currently open to and seeking internships and entry level web development job opportunities.</p>

                </a> 
                <p>My task for this project was to build a functional survey form using HTML and a CSS style sheet. This was a FreeCodeCamp project and I decided to go with a survey that targeted FreeCodeCamp users to collect feedback on their desired rolls as a developer, their skills, and their experience. Entries can be entered into all fields on the form and it can be submitted once completed.</p>
                <h4>Tribute Page: HTML5, CSS</h4>

                </a>
                <p>The objective for this project was to build a tribute page dedicated to someone important to you using HTML and a CSS style sheet. The focus was building an informative website with a timeline of impactful events that happened in the persons life and career. I chose Masahiro Sakurai because he developed my all time favorite game, <i>Super Smash Bros. Melee</i>, for the Nintendo Gamecube.</p>
